# 27th September 2023
First look at my final year project in terms of how I will approach my project.
The two things I want to establish before my meeting with my supervisor on Friday.

* What are the constraints and how effective are they for solving puzzles.
* What programming language will I use with its documentation.

Tomorrow I also want to start on my plan, but I will further investigate my plan after speaking to my supervisor.

# 28th September 2023
Looking back on my objectives yesterday I have made decision on what programming language I would like to implement.

I looked to use Python since it has a specific framework for making games called pygame

## Pygame
Is a set of modules designed to write video games that include video graphics and sound libraries.

With the use of pygame, I will be able to make Sokoban a lot easier and insert constraint programming techniques with.

Today I want to research on constraint programming and how well it will work with python.

# 29th September 2023
I have met with my supervisor today to discuss some of the techinques and the game I want to do.

My supervisor mentioned making Sokoban the game choice for my puzzle.

## Sokoban
Sokoban originated from Japan and it's a game revolves around pushing boxes to different areas of the level to solve the puzzle.

We also discussed some of the techniques I could implement such as Backtracking which I will research more into when I do my project plan.

# Week 6
This week I will like to design a playable level for the user to solve.

To do this I will need to:

* Customise and design the sprites used for this project
* Draw the grid out for the level
* Handle user input

It may be unrealistic to get all 3 of these tasks done this week but, I would like to get at least two of these tasks completed this week so that I can focus my attention on implementing CSP techniques for that level.

# Week 7
Due to troubles with assignments and family concerns, the previous week has been difficult to fit in final year project work.

However, now that assignments have been cleared, I can now focus on week 6 and start on AI.

I will be doing some of my project during the holiday due to my setbacks in the past two months so progression will be recorded as holiday progression as the subtitle.

# Week 8
Focus on this week is completing the report and presenting my work thus far.

# Christmas Break 
Focused on research and got more information on how to implement AI algorithms.

The code works now so will be looking into improving it with sprites and new levels.

# Week 9-11
Implement AI algorithms for the basic code.

Improve aesthetics of the game, add the sprites to make it look sophisticated.

# Week 10
Complete bug fixes for the simple level and doing more research into AI algorithms in this code.

# Week 11
Do more levels, complete the interface of the game. Allow great accessibility for the user to access the game. 
To achieve this, I will be looking into implementing a hash map, to allow levels to transverse between eachother on each level completion.

# Week 12
Fix the bug of my code where the game does not end when told to. Implement the AI aspect of everything this week with thought of knowledge from planning.

# Week 13
Implement the A* Search given from the testing one made externally to this project, figure out the logic of moving the box to a target. Start final report.

Complete the heuristics.

# Week 14
Complete docummentation, final debug changes and complete final report.
